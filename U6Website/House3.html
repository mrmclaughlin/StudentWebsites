			<aside>The room's floor, ceiling, and walls are made of trampolines in front of soundproof foam to silence the springs. Although this room is for the children, it is put on the parent's floor so that, in the event of an injury, adults are nearby.</aside>
			<p id="ob"><span>Observatory</span></p>
			<aside>This room is centered around a very large pivoting telescope that looks out of the glass ceiling. It is large and dark, to mimic the night sky.</aside>
